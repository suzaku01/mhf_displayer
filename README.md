mhf_displayer is a C# form that shows hit points of large monster on display.  
This project is WIP, and has some issues.  
Currently, only High Grade Edition is supported.

# Download
Go release section and download latest version.

# Usage
After game has started, run `mhf_displayer.exe`.  
Windows Defender may try to scan app only once at the beginning of launch.  
This is because mhf_displayer accesses game memory.

# Known issues
When you go some specific quests, it shows strange value, for a moment.

# Changelog

## v1.0
Initial release.
