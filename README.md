mhf_displayer is a C# form that shows hit points of large monster on display.  
This project is WIP, and has some issues.  
Currently, only High Grade Edition is supported.

D3D has an overlay function, if you have enough knowledge you can do similar things with that.

# Download
Go release section and download latest version.

# Usage
After game has started, run `mhf_displayer.exe`.  
Windows Defender may try to scan app only once at the beginning of launch.  
This is because mhf_displayer accesses game memory.

# Known issues
When you go some specific quests, it shows strange value, for a moment.

# Changelog

## v1.0
Initial release.
