# Description
mhf_displayer is a C# form that shows various useful infomations on display.  

# Download
Go release section and download latest version.

# Build
Drop `mhf_displayer.cfg` to the same place where exe created if you build it yourself.

# Usage
After the game has started, run `mhf_displayer.exe`.  
It's recommended to start displayer while you are in lobby, otherwise it will crash.  
Windows Defender may scan the app only once at the beginning of launch, this is because displayer accesses game memory.  
`mhf_displayer.cfg` file is used to store your config value.  

To access config menu right click somewhere on displays.

While you are in config menu, you can move displays(player panel, monster panel etc.)ã€€by drag and drop

To toggle monster, press `LeftAlt`+`F12`. (v1.6: doesn't work (?))
